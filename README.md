Home automation platform for IoT devices like ESP8266 and ESP32, most of it is built on Typescript and C++

The documentation is divided into several sections:

1. [Components of project](#components-of-project)
2. [Communication and data transmission](#communication-and-data-transmission)

## Components of project
* [Backend infrastructure](#backend-infrastructure)
* [Web App](#web-app)
* [Mobile App](#mobile-app)
* [Embedded devices](#embedded-devices)
* [Firestore database](#firestore-database)
* [Firebase FCM](#firestore-database)
* [Project types](#project-types)

### Backend infrastructure
Server and infrastructure recently had a huge refactor. It will soon move from monolythic to microservices, [here](https://github.com/gbaranski/homeflow/issues/78)
1. [MQTT Broker](#mqtt-broker)
2. [Device service](#device-service)
3. [Auth service](#auth-service)
4. [OTA service](#ota-service)

##### MQTT Broker
Broker which I picked is [emqx](https://github.com/emqx/emqx) because it supports webhooks and authentication out of box
##### Device service
It will help MQTT Broker as webhook service, it will change state of devices in firestore.
##### Auth service
Adds authentication on MQTT broker
##### OTA service
Handle updates over the air for embedded devices


### Web App
Web app made using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) front-end framework, whole code is in Typescript. App has moved from [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), to [antd](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)

### Mobile App
Mobile app made using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), I picked it over React Native.

### Embedded devices
Embedded devices, microcontrollers i used were ESP8266 and ESP32, those are modules with WiFi. I was using Arduino framework, and C++ languague, thought about C and ESP-IDF but it would take me months. 

Devices I made
- Alarmclock on ESP32, just an alarmclock, but with LCD and loud siren to wake me up, also measures temperature and etc, not supported..
- Watermixer on ESP8266, switches relay which activates mixing hot and cold water, currently the device which mostly I focus on.
- Watermixer on Raspberry, made in Node.JS, just to test how it would look like, but its too expensive to make those, currently used for tests.

#### Alarmclock

### Firestore database
Project is using [Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for storing devices, users and etc

### Firebase FCM
[Firebase cloud messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging), currently used only for [mobile app](#mobile-app), but in future I expect to use it also for [Web App](#web-app)

### Project types
Types for Typescript, helps a lot with planning, and having cohesion between project components.

## Communication and data transmission
Communication is made on MQTT, clients connects to [MQTT Broker](#mqtt-broker) aswell as embedded devices, they send requests between them.

#### Security

* [Embedded devices](#embedded-devices-security)
* [Web/Mobile Client](#webmobile-client)


##### Embedded devices security
Embedded devices when they try to connect to MQTT broker, they send a secret and their uid, [Auth service](#auth-service) checks if thats allowed to connect, if yes it passed.

##### Web/Mobile Client
Web/Mobile clients are authenticated a little bit different, clients can log in via Google/Email and if they do, they can get authenticated by generating JWT token from Firebase and then sending it with websocket handshake.
